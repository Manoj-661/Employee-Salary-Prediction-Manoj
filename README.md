# üíº Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether an individual earns **more than 50K USD annually** based on personal and work-related attributes using various machine learning models. A final **Streamlit web app** is built for real-time prediction.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Dataset:** UCI Adult Income Dataset
- **Goal:** Predict salary category (`<=50K` or `>50K`)
- **ML Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier ‚úÖ *(Final model)*
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## üöÄ Web App Demo

The web app is built using **Streamlit**. It lets users input details like age, education, work class, etc., and predicts the salary category.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-prediction-app.git
   cd salary-prediction-app
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   streamlit run salary_prediction_app.py
